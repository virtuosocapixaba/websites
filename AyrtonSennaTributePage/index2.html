            <p>Ayrton Senna is regarded by many as the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time. <br>
                His quick racing pace, amazing qualifying laps, incredible car control in the wet, and daring overtakes made him a legend of motorsport. <br>
                His unique driving style really impressed fans and other racing drivers. <br>
                His sudden death at the San Marino GP in 1994 shocked the world and ended a brilliant racing career.</p>
            <p>Although his career ended suddenly Senna managed to achieve some very impressive feats in Formula One:</p>
            <p>
                3 world titles<br>
                41 race wins<br>
                65 pole positions<br>
                80 podium finishes<br>
                19 fastest laps<br>
            </p>
            <p>Senna became an inspiration to many successful Formula One drivers such as Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.</p>
